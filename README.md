# polenum

polenum is a tool for remotely extracting information about the password policy of a Windows host.

This is a fork of the polenum tool originally published by portcullis labs ( https://labs.portcullis.co.uk/tools/polenum/ ). This version is designed to fix an issue where times (such as lockout duration, password expiration, etc.) would be reported incorrectly in some circumstances. This version is designed to retain compatibility with enum4linux (https://labs.portcullis.co.uk/tools/enum4linux/).
